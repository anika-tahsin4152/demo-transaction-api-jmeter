# demo-transaction-api-jmeter

## About Project
## The JMeter test plan models a positive transaction flow within a financial system involving an admin, agent, and customer. The scenario includes creating an agent and a customer, depositing 2000 tk into the agent's account from the system account, transferring 1000 tk from the agent's account to the customer's account, checking the customer's balance to verify the deposit, withdrawing 500 tk from the customer's account, and making a 200 tk payment from the customer's account to a specified merchant account. This JMX file is designed to execute these steps seamlessly, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of these financial operations.
